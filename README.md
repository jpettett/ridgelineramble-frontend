## Ridgeline Ramble
  As an active member of the hiking, trail running and backcountry volunteer community, I understand how important it is to be able to have ready access to a blog style website. Ridgeline Ramble is a place to jot down ideas, thoughts and feelings from the trail. Some of those ideas workout and can be sent to larger publications, others don't hold up and can easily be edited or even deleted.

## Technologies used
  Ridgeline Ramble is built with a Python/Django RESTful API and a React front end. It is styled using a combination of CSS and React Bootstrap. Users can easily read, create, update, delete their posts.
  
## Contribution
  I would love to see Ridgeline Ramble grow! Please feel free to fork and clone this repository, add your creative updates and submit a pull request for review. 
  
## Future Updates
  There are several future updates in the works for Ridgeline Ramble. Currently I am working on adding user authentication so that the blog will be private to each user. Further down the road I hope to open this application into a forum/message board style site with topics including: Backpacking, hiking, trail running and mountain biking and volunteering.  

### Notes
Special thanks to Katie Boyles for help with setting the RR logo!
